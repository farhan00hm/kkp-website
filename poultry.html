        At KKP, "free-range" means that our birds have daily access to outdoor areas where they can forage, dust bathe, and express their natural behaviors. They are not confined to cages and have spacious shelter for nighttime protection and during extreme weather. Our chickens, ducks, and geese have access to open pastures where they can freely roam and supplement their diet with insects, grass, and other natural foods.

            Hens naturally lay eggs regardless of whether a rooster is present. The eggs we sell for consumption are unfertilized, meaning they were laid by hens without mating with roosters. While we do keep some roosters in separate breeding flocks for hatching new chicks, our egg-laying flocks consist primarily of hens that produce eggs as part of their natural cycle.

            The color of an egg shell is determined by the breed of chicken and has no impact on the nutritional value or taste. White-feathered chickens with white earlobes typically lay white eggs, while brown-feathered chickens with red earlobes typically lay brown eggs. All our eggs, regardless of shell color, come from free-range hens fed the same high-quality organic diet, resulting in equally nutritious and delicious eggs.

            We collect eggs twice daily - once in the morning and once in the late afternoon. This frequent collection ensures maximum freshness and minimizes the chance of eggs becoming soiled or damaged. The eggs are then cleaned (if necessary), inspected for quality, sorted by size, and refrigerated promptly. This careful process ensures that our customers receive the freshest possible eggs.

            Our eggs cost more because of our sustainable farming practices. We provide our birds with more space, organic feed, access to outdoors, and natural living conditions. Conventional factory farms keep birds in tight cages with limited movement to maximize production while minimizing costs. Our methods prioritize animal welfare and environmental sustainability, resulting in superior quality products that are more nutritious and flavorful, but that do require more resources to produce.
